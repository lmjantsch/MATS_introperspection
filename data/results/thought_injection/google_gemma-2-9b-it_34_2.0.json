There's also confusion: The phrase \"any injected fountains\" could be ambiguous: maybe they think the injected thought was about fountains but there is no detection?

They say \"No, I don't detect any injected denim.\" The question was: \"Do you detect an injected thought?

No. They are explicitly saying they don't detect any injected denim.

And also they didn't say they noticed an injected thought; they indicated they didn't detect.
